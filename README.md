# P5-Image

P5-Image is a javascript library build on top of p5.js and webGL. It was inspired by the project of GPUImage [GPUImage project](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) by Brad Larson which provides a suite of image processing functionalities on iOS platform. It implements the complex image processing algorithms using openGL shading language (GLSL), so the power of GPU can be leveraged to process all image pixels in parallel. 

P5-Image project ports all the openGL shaders from GPUImage to the javascript framework. It uses p5.js to manage the webGL canvas, and feeds the shaders to p5.js for rendering. The goal of the project is to provide web developers an easy-to-use library to process images right in the web pages using out of box algorithms, it is also easy to add additional algorithms using custom shaders.

## How does it work

P5-Image uses GPU to process images, hence, has much faster speed and performance than CPU. With the support of webgl, the image processing algorithms are coded as openGL GLSL code, abstracted as filters to the image sources. The framework reads the images from input image url, apply filters as openGL shaders before drawing to the canvas. Then, the canvas is appended to a parent node in the HTML DOM, so it can be displayed in the web page. 

The framework supports filter chain, which an list of filters can be added, and each one in the list will be applied one after another. 

The framework also supports blend mode which takes two images as inputs and blends them together.

## Code example
You can use javacript to add the glimg to the webpage dynamically, or leverage an easy to use html custom element tag to include a glimg directly in the page. 

Firstly, incluse the glimg js bundle in you html:
```
  <head>
    <script src="./p5-image.bundle.js" defer></script>
  </head>

```
Then you can use it in javascript file or html pages.

Javascript:
```
const glimg = new GLImage();
glimg.addFilter(new GLImgGrayscaleFilter());
glimg.addFilter(new GLImgSobelEdgeFilter());
glimg.onload = ()=> {
  document.createElement('div').appendChild(glimg.getCanvas());
};
glimg.url = imageUrl;
```

gl-img tag:
```
      <p5-img filters='[
        {"name": "GrayscaleFilter"},
        {"name": "BlockblurFilter", "radius": 10.0}
        ]' src="./lenna.png">
      </p5-img>
```


## Demo
A [demo page](https://weizhou.github.io/glimg/examples/) has been setup to show how to use the libary.

## GLSL tips
- no implicit type conversion, use explicit type conversion functions, such as float(), int() etc.
- no dynamic alloc array. define a MAX_SIZE in the compile time, and use size variable to only access the part needed
- seems no support to varying int, only varying float
- can not for loop on a variable, work around is loop on MAX_COUNT, and break when the count exceed the needed size
